### Providers

Providers are a fundamental concept in Nest. Many of the basic Nest classes may be treated as a provider â€“ services, repositories, factories, helpers, and so on. The main idea of a provider is that it can be **injected** as a dependency; this means objects can create various relationships with each other, and the function of "wiring up" these objects can largely be delegated to the Nest runtime system.

Now that we have defined a provider (`SnakesService`), and we have a consumer of that service (`SnakesController`), we need to register the service with Nest so that it can perform the injection. We do this by editing our module file (`snakes_module.py``) and adding the service to the `providers` array of the `@Module()` decorator.

Nest will now be able to resolve the dependencies of the `SnakesController` class.

```py title="snakes_module.py" linenums="1" hl_lines="7 8"
from nest.common.decorators import Module

from snakes.snakes_controller import SnakesController 
from snakes.snakes_service import SnakesService

@Module(
    controllers=[SnakesController], # (1)
    providers=[SnakesService] # (2)
)
class SnakesModule: 
    pass
```
